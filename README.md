# Text Summarization using BART

This project demonstrates text summarization using the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model. BART is a transformer model trained as a denoising autoencoder and is effective for text generation tasks such as summarization.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess text data.
- **Summarization Model**: A BART model for text summarization.
- **Training Script**: Train the model with text data.
- **Summarization Script**: Generate text summaries using the trained model.
- **Results Visualization**: Save and view generated summaries.
